This chrome extension works works with the Diaspora social network.
It takes the functionality of the standard bookmarklet and puts it
instead in a chrome extension for ease of use.

To learn more about Diaspora, check out www.joindiaspora.com, or
check out their git repository at github.com/diaspora/diaspora.

This extension is not currently "packaged" or in the Chrome
extension gallery, so you'll have to load it yourself. It would be
nice to distribute this sans Google, so any ideas on that front
also welcomed.

TODOs:
Generally make prettier
Look into Firefox plugins?
